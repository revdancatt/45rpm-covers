## About

After the minimal week was over (which included the 45rpm, 33.333rpm and 78rpm works) I created pieces to be given as "Air Drops" to owners of 45rpm. These are the album covers that are supposed to go over the 45rpm ringle.

This single cover is based on the cover design for OMD's English Electric by Peter Saville and Top Skipp. This project is a simple deconstruction of the elements in that design, which are reconstructed and expanded in code. A thought experiment in "what if this cover, but done with code?"
